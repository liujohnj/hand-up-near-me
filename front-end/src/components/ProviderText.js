            <p>If you are a provider of free or reduced-fee services, now more than at any time in recent history, there are a large number of struggling members of our community who can use your help.</p>
            
            <p>Quite often, though, those who are in the most need don't have a good, current resource to help them find their way to you, especially with all the "noise" on the Internet.</p>

            <p>Hand Up Near Me hopes to serve as a single starting point where those users who are in need of services may find the providers who can furnish them.  From this website, they can use a very simple user interface to match providers with desired services.  Further, they can search by distance to find the providers nearest them.</p>
            
            <p>As a registered provider on this website (which is operated by volunteers and operates solely on donations), your organization or agency will have your its own free profile page that it can edit and update at any time.  Of course, there is no cost at all to either providers or users.  Bless you for your wonderful works, and thank you for your service!</p>
